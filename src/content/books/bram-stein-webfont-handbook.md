  There’s more to choosing a webfont than aesthetics—rendering, language support, hosting, and licensing are equally crucial to communicating your message. Think of webfonts as progressive enhancement, and learn how to harness CSS and browser features to improve performance. From selection to optimization, Bram Stein’s primer shows you how webfonts can make the web a more visually diverse, efficient, and readable environment.
