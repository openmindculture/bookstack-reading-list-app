author: "St√©phanie Walter"
description: |
  A user journey map is a powerful asset that's used to understand how people use our products. It is an essential tool for building websites, applications, and services. By visualizing user goals, phases in the journey, tasks, pain points, and sometimes feelings, a map can help teams build products by showing a global view of the user's journey, bringing stakeholders and product teams together. It can be used to brainstorm new opportunities, fix issues, design new services, and understand gaps within an organization.
