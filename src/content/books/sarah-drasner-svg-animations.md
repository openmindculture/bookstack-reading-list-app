title: "SVG Animations: From Common UX Implementations to Complex Responsive Animation"
author: "Sarah Drasner"
description: |
  SVG is extremely powerful, with its reduced HTTP requests and crispness on any display. It becomes increasingly more interesting as you explore its capabilities for responsive animation and performance boons. When you animate SVG, you must be aware of normal image traits like composition, color, implementation, and optimization. But when you animate, it increases the complexity of each of these factors exponentially.

  This practical book takes a deep dive into how you can to solve these problems.
