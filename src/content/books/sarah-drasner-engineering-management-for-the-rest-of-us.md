title: "Engineering Management for the Rest of Us"
author: "Sarah Drasner"
description: |
  There seem to be millions of articles and "how to"s on programming and only a handful of resources on Engineering Management- why? It can be very tough for those of us who didn't go into Engineering with the distinct concept that we would become managers, but still want to do our best to support our teams.

   Sarah Drasner shares what no one told her about management that she wished she would have known.
