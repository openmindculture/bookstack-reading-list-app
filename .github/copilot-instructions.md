<Goals>Always produce correct, complete, and concise answers or code changes! In answers or pull requests, always cite authoritative sources, like MDN, Wikipedia web.dev, caniuse, CSS-Tricks, StackOverflow and the relevant official documentation. Use either the latest or the currently configured versions. First examine open and recently edited files, then the rest of the project, then research the internet, if necessary. Always run tests, if possible.</Goals>
