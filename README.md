# Bookstack Reading List App

**This is a work in progress, not meant to be used in production (at least not yet).**

A Reading List web app built using Preact, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS with typography, forms, tailwind JIT compilation, and a simple back-end based on Node, Express, and MongoDB.

This is the first project based on my [Tailwind-JIT-MERN-Starter](https://github.com/openmindculture/tailwind-jit-mern),
which was forked from forked from [Retinafunk's Tailwind-JIT-Starter](https://github.com/retinafunk/tailwind-jit).

The app should be deployed "in the cloud" (e.g. on Amazon Web Services).
TypeScript is currently only used in the front-end.
